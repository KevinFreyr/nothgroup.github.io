### Usability goals

All goals are predicted to be measured in low-fi prototype, therefore the time measure is prolonged.

#### 1.

* It takes a user 20 seconds to change the font to another font
* 95% of users will finish changing the font to another font
* Users will grade their satisfaction for changing the font to another font above 4 on average on a scale from 1-5

### Interview outcome

The paper prototype interviews went really well with the interviewees.
Although most of them had problems with task 2: generate a summary of longer text.
It took them a little while to figure out that they could highlight the text and right click.
Besides that everything went really well and the interviewees liked the concept and our paper prototype itself.

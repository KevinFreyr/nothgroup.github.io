### Introduction

We are 4 students making a software called ReFormer. Which is a software that helps people reading text on web pages. We are aiming for dyslexic people and people with reading impairment. The software is an extension in a web browser and it can change the text formatting of any text on a given page.

We would be delightful if you can take about 20 minutes of your time to take two questionnaires and six tasks. This is a formal user observation.

Kevin Freyr Leósson will evaluate you and Randver Pálmi Gyðuson will observe the evaluation.

Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions.You will also have support material which are descriptions of how the tasks could be solved.

#### Pre-evaluation questionnaire
* Age:

* Are you dyslexic or have reading impairment?

* Computer knowledge?

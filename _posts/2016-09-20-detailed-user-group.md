**Group name**:Students

**Background**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Age**: 14-35

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Gender**: An equal number of girls and boys are dyslexic. It is thought that boys are more likely to act out as a result of having a reading difficulty and are therefore more likely to be identified early. Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to try to "hide" their difficulty, becoming quiet and reserved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Education**: In different stages of the education system all from high school through university

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Abilities/disabilities**: They all have similar problems reading text, the severity of the problem is different though.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**General computer knowledge**: Generally computer knowledge is well above average for students.

**The Usage**:
* How often: Daily use, mostly when studying or doing assignments.
* How much each time: That depends on the time needed to finish studying or finishing assignments. Around couple of hours a day.
* The users skills: This particular system requires minimal skills to operate, and only knowledge of how to install Google extensions, that is a 2 click operation so it should be for everyone to install.
* Estimated number of users: 15-20% of all students.

**The Context of Use**:
* The real environment: The system would be used at school and at home for students that study at home.

* The technical environment: Our software is a chrome extension which is a program that is used in the Google Chrome browser.

**The User Goals**:
* The main goals that this user group wants to accomplish: The most important and main goal of this user group is reading text unhindered from their disability.

**The Importance**:
* How important is the user group for making the system?
    * This is the core user group for the system, most of them would hopefully use the software in the future after their studies are done

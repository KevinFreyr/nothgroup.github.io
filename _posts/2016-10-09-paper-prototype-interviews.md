### The Interview

We introduced the project to the interviewee and described the goal of the interview. That is that we are testing the usability of the software but not the problem solving skills of the interviewee. 

We started, by asking the user to solve task 1: activate the reformer and and find the definition for the second sentance. After the interviewee solved that task we asked him to solve task 2: generate a summary of longer text.

Finally we wanted to test the customization the app offers and asked the interviewee to solve task 3. Task 3 was to change the font and background and font color.

After the interviewee finished the tasks we asked him about his experience using the app and thanked him for his participation.

### Results 1

We conducted the first interview at the Reykjavik University Library. Interviewee 1 completed all the tasks in a matter of few minutes, without any problems. He found it easy to discover how the features worked and liked hovering over for definitions. The only problem that halted his quick progress was that he had to highlight and right click to generate a summary.

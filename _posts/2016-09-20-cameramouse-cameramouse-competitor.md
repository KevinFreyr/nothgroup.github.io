# CameraMouse -  A CameraMouse Competitor 

It has the same name as my software. That was not deliberate might be that I have seen this software before and my subconscious made me name my software the same.

The Camera Mouse is a free software that allows the person control the mouse pointer just by moving their head. Clicking is done using "dwell time," by holding the mouse pointer within a small area of the screen for a second or two. Or you can click in the regular way using the mouse button or a switch.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strenghts**


- It is a free software anyone can download.
- Works through a built-in webcam or standard USB webcam.
- Settings for clicking, how long the dwell time is until it clicks.
- If you move the mouse itself the control returns to the mouse.
- Has been granted a “100% Clean” award by Softpedia.



**Weaknesses**


- Only works for Windows.
- Accuracy can be less precise depending on what type of camera you are using.

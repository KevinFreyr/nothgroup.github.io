- Photo of the affinity diagram after the walking of the wall: wtw.png stored in _posts
- Description of how the walk of the wall happened

I began by describing the software we were working on, who it was for and what it would do. I showed the vision from Project 2 to make sure we were on the same page on what kind of software we were talking about. I quickly went over the personas just to describe how 'personas' worked as a consept and did the same for the affinity diagram. I finally described wat it was that was expected of this session and defined the goal as expressed in the slides. When everything was clearly defined and no further questions, the session formally began. 

There is little to say about the actual session. Except for one or two questions, the session went on completely silent. Finally we had a good list of new design ideas from the group and no one had anything to add.

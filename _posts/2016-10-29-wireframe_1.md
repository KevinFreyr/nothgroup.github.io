We using created a new prototype using the results from the paper prototype interviews.

## Reformer Menu
By clicking the icon the user is presented by a menu where he can quickly  turn options on and off.

### Main Menu
![main menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/image/prototype1/0-reformer-64012898-1477917074.png)
The main options are presented immediately as toggle buttons for an ease of control.
Based on our previous interview the access to the summary generator was too hidden on right click, we therefore added a button to the menu list.
More detailed settings are available in deeper level menus to prevent overcrowding the list. 

### Settings
![settings menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/image/prototype1/1-settings-64016404-1477910499.png)

### Font Settings

Here the user can change the font settings, directly on the screen, by sliding and selecting a value from a dropdown menu.
By offering the changes directly, we avoid to deeply nested menus.

### Highlighting Settings

Here we allow the user both to select a predefined value and input his own. The input field supports hex, rbb, and natural language words, f.x. 'yellow'.

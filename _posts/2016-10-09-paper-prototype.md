## The Paper Prototype
Since we target multiple platforms, we had to chose one to create our prototype for. We decided to create one for the Chrome Extension. 


![screen1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/prototype/screen1.jpg)
The first screen shows a document in the browser and Reformer in the extension slot.

By clicking the reformer icon, the user is presented with a menu. The menu allows the user to quickly toggle to activate different features, without the need for any configuration.

By activating the Reformer, the text on the page changes immediately. The background and font change to a user configurable option and hard to read sentences and words are highlighted.

By highlighting a block of text and clicking generate summary, a summary of the text selected is generated.
Users are already familiar with selecting an block of text for options such as print and copy.

Summary is presented next to the text.

By hoovering over the highlighted text, a simpler alternative is presented. This allows the user to quickly view a definition of a hard to read text without breaking focus.

Similarly, convoluted words are defined by hoovering over.

The settings option in the main menu allows the user to customize the presentation.
The settings menu is simple and offers the user both to configure the presentation and how the text is reformed, along with general options.

![screen9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/prototype/screen9.jpg)
Clicking the font options allow the user to customize the font used, size, color, background and spacing.
The number option is changed by clicking the arrows or by typing in a number to support both users who prefer mouse and keyboards.

![screen10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/prototype/screen10.jpg)
By clicking the font option the user can select his preferred font

![screen12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOTHGroup/nothgroup.github.io/master/prototype/screen12.jpg)
The user is presented with list of background colors supported

The app is reactive to all user changes and the presentation is updated immediately for user feedback

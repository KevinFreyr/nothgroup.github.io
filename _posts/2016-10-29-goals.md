TODO: The first thing you do is to state measureable goals for your system for both the usability and user experience. State at least 3 goals each of the usability factors (at least one should be measureable using a low-fi prototype) and 3 for the user experience. At least one of those should be measurable. Deliverable: At least 12 measureable goals for your system.

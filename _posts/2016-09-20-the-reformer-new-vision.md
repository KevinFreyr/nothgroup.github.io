# Reformer - Further development and updated vision

## Reasoning

We chose to develope the Reformer further. 
The main reason behind that choice is that the dyslexic user group is larger than our other groups.
This makes it easier to find users to interview for the contextual interviews than in the other more niche groups.

## Vision 2.0

*TODO: Add vision*
